# LeetCode Mastery: The Collaborative Guide

## About This Repository

This repository contains a comprehensive guide for mastering algorithmic problem solving with a focus on LeetCode-style questions. I created this guide after extensive research and personal experience, with input from AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude to compile and organize the information effectively.

Unlike many other resources that focus on solving random problems, this guide emphasizes learning and recognizing **patterns**, which is the key to solving algorithmic problems efficiently.

## What Makes This Guide Different

- **Pattern-Based Approach**: Organized by problem-solving techniques rather than difficulty levels
- **Strategic Roadmap**: 12-week study plan with spaced repetition for better retention
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 150+ carefully selected problems covering all major patterns
- **Practical Walkthrough**: Detailed explanations of how to recognize and implement each pattern

## How Collaboration Works

This is meant to be a living document that improves through community contributions. You can participate in several ways:

### GitHub Discussions
- Share your alternative solutions
- Ask questions about specific patterns or problems
- Discuss optimization techniques

### Issues
- Report errors or unclear explanations
- Suggest improvements to existing content
- Propose new sections or patterns to cover

### Pull Requests
- Fix code examples or explanations
- Add new problem solutions
- Improve explanations

## Repository Structure

```

## Getting Started

1. **For learners**: Start with the introduction and follow the 12-week study plan
2. **For contributors**: Check the contributing.md file for guidelines
3. **For discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions to engage with the community

## Future Plans

As this is a collaborative project, I plan to enhance it with:

- Interactive examples
- Visualizations of algorithms
- Language-specific implementations
- Mock interview questions
